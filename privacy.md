  <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
	<p>I use Google Analytics to see how many readers I've got, and also what they find interesting. </p>

	<h4>Disqus</h4>
	<p>To enable people to read and write comments, I'm including a Disqus plugin at the bottom of each page.</p>

	<h4>Should I accept the cookies?</h4>
	<p>If you click accept on the cookie banner, you accept the usage of these cookies for 30 days. If you come back after these days, you'll have to make another decision to accept them or not. You do not need to accept them and you'll be able to read the articles just fine without them.</p>
