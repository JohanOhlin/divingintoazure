	<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span> swede currently amused by the strange situation this (not so) United Kingdom has ended up with due to the Brexit limbo it has positioned itself in. I'm glad I wasn't allowed to vote - no one can blame me!</p>	
	
  <h4>Describing myself</h4>
	<p>Christian, husband, entrepreneur, world traveller, blog writer, allotment novice and programmer. Enjoy spending hours letting my coding creativity finding inspiration at some nice cafe around the corner.</p>

	<h4>Technologies I focus on</h4>
	<p>This is something that can vary quite some over time. For the last years, Microsoft's cloud solution Azure has been of quite some interest, with a specific focus on CosmosDb and AKS. I prefer .NET Core over the old framework, but that doesn't mean I've managed to convince my boss yet. React enforced by Typescript is a given winner - I don't mind the overhead TS brings.</p>

	<h4>I write about</h4>
	<p>You will indeed find a lot of posts about the topics I focus on. But some are also summaries and guide lines for myself and as such they can cover many other areas that I find of interest. I hope you something find useful to read...</p>
